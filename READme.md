The Hospital Database Application, part of my Capstone Project at Purwadhika Data Science Program, simplifies data management for a fictional hospital. This application fully uses python, with an English language interface. Key features include:

1. Display Current Data: View the existing patient database in an organized tabulated format.
2. Create New Data: Add new patient entries with unique registration numbers, age, diagnosis, and hospital status.
3. Remove Data: Delete patient records based on their unique registration numbers.
4. Modify Data: Update patient information using registration numbers.
5. Look Up Patient Data: Retrieve specific patient details by searching with their registration numbers.
6. Closing the program.
